## Chartselection

- One **good** graph is better than 7 bad ones

- If you have to include more graphs: Better build them up gradually than showing 7 completely different ones

- Use **differnt types** of graphs (if possible). If you go home and say "oh do you remember that bar-chart?" It's hard if you only had bar-graphs... Also look [here](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/telling-a-story.html#make-a-figure-for-the-generals)


## Use Words

- Look for Amandy Cox's talk on the Datawrapper-Conf (Unwrapped).
- Use verbs! The title in a datawrapper should use verbs!

## Use Hierachy
